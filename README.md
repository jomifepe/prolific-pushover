# Prolific Pushover

Simple script that polls Prolific's [notification list](https://app.prolific.co/studies) and sends notificatons through [Pushover](https://pushover.net/).

Since Prolific doesn't have a way to receive notifications on mobile, and removed the polling interval from the Prolific Assistant extension, this script can help you be notified more quickly and on multiple devices.
